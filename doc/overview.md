Overview
========

Intel Open Image Denoise is an open source library of high-performance,
high-quality denoising filters for images rendered with ray tracing.
Intel Open Image Denoise is part of the
[Intel® oneAPI Rendering Toolkit](https://software.intel.com/en-us/oneapi/render-kit)
and is released under the permissive
[Apache 2.0 license](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

The purpose of Intel Open Image Denoise is to provide an open, high-quality,
efficient, and easy-to-use denoising library that allows one to significantly
reduce rendering times in ray tracing based rendering applications. It filters
out the Monte Carlo noise inherent to stochastic ray tracing methods like path
tracing, reducing the amount of necessary samples per pixel by even multiple
orders of magnitude (depending on the desired closeness to the ground truth).
A simple but flexible C/C++ API ensures that the library can be easily
integrated into most existing or new rendering solutions.

At the heart of the Intel Open Image Denoise library is a collection of
efficient deep learning based denoising filters, which were trained to handle
a wide range of samples per pixel (spp), from 1 spp to almost fully converged.
Thus it is suitable for both preview and final-frame rendering. The filters can
denoise images either using only the noisy color (*beauty*) buffer, or, to
preserve as much detail as possible, can optionally utilize auxiliary feature
buffers as well (e.g. albedo, normal). Such buffers are supported by most
renderers as arbitrary output variables (AOVs) or can be usually implemented
with little effort.

Although the library ships with a set of pre-trained filter models, it is not
mandatory to use these. To optimize a filter for a specific renderer, sample
count, content type, scene, etc., it is possible to train the model using the
included training toolkit and user-provided image datasets.

Intel Open Image Denoise supports a wide variety of CPUs and GPUs from different
vendors:

-   Intel® 64 architecture compatible CPUs (with at least SSE4.1)

-   Apple Silicon CPUs

-   Intel Xe architecture GPUs, both dedicated and integrated, including
    Intel® Arc™ A-Series Graphics, Intel® Data Center GPU Flex Series (Xe-HPG
    microarchitecture), Intel® Data Center GPU Max Series (Xe-HPC),
    11th-13th Gen Intel® Core™ processor graphics, and related Intel Pentium®
    and Celeron® processors (Xe-LP)

-   NVIDIA GPUs with Volta, Turing, Ampere, Ada Lovelace, and Hopper
    architectures

-   AMD GPUs with RDNA2 (Navi 21 only) and RDNA3 (Navi 3x) architectures

It runs on most machines ranging from laptops to workstations and compute nodes
in HPC systems. It is efficient enough to be suitable not only for offline
rendering, but, depending on the hardware used, also for interactive or even
real-time ray tracing.

Intel Open Image Denoise exploits modern instruction sets like Intel SSE4, AVX2,
and AVX-512 on CPUs, Intel® Xe Matrix Extensions (Intel® XMX) on Intel GPUs, and
tensor cores on NVIDIA GPUs to achieve high denoising performance.


System Requirements
-------------------

You need a CPU with SSE4.1 support or Apple Silicon to run Intel Open Image
Denoise, and you need a 64-bit Windows, Linux, or macOS operating system as well.

For Intel GPU support, please also install the latest Intel graphics drivers:

-   Windows:
    [Intel® Graphics Driver](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/726609/intel-arc-iris-xe-graphics-whql-windows.html)
    31.0.101.4314 or newer for Intel® Arc™ Graphics, 11th-13th Gen Intel® Core™
    processor graphics, and related Intel Pentium® and Celeron® processors

-   Linux:
    [Intel® software for General Purpose GPU capabilities](https://dgpu-docs.intel.com/driver/installation.html)
    release [20230323](https://dgpu-docs.intel.com/releases/stable_602_20230323.html)
    or newer

Using older driver versions is *not* supported and Intel Open Image Denoise
might run with only limited capabilities, have suboptimal performance or might
be unstable. Also, Resizable BAR *must* be enabled in the BIOS for Intel
dedicated GPUs if running on Linux, and strongly recommended if running on
Windows.

For NVIDIA GPU support, please also install the latest
[NVIDIA graphics drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/drivers/):

-   Windows: Version 522.06 or newer

-   Linux: Version 520.61.05 or newer

For AMD GPU support, please also install the latest
[AMD graphics drivers](https://www.amd.com/en/support):

-   Windows: AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition 23.4.3 Driver Version 22.40.51.05 or newer

-   Linux: [Radeon Software for Linux](https://www.amd.com/en/support/linux-drivers)
    version 22.40.5 or newer
